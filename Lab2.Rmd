Homework Assignment 2  

Objective:
Based on a subsample of the most frequently occuring tree genera in the data, we will test whether project areas are indepentdant in terms of carbon output.

Methods:
The data will first be corrected for missing or unrealistic values.  A subset of the most frequent genera will be tested for independence (Chi-square test) based upon observaton counts within genera by project site and a map of project sites generated.
  Data:
  Data from 4 Northern California riparian project sites between 3/20/2012 and 10/14/2013: Heritage Oak Winery, Cosumnes River Preserve, Sacramento River Red Bluff to Hwy 32, and Napa.  Observations and field measurements of woody plant heights, DBH (diameter at breast height).  Samples were identified by genus-Species.
  Code:
  ```{r}
  #read data into r
  ripdata <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Documents/Writings/Spring 2016/ES 207/Labs/Lab1/riparian_survey.csv")
  
  #summarize data, looking for false values.
  
  summary(ripdata)
  #-9999 values in ripdata[,15], ripdata[,14], removing values
  
  ripdata[ripdata == -9999] <- NULL
  summary(ripdata)
  str(ripdata)
 
 #changing Project Codes to simplified codes
 tempo <- levels(ripdata[,2])
 tempn <- factor(c("CORP", "HOWY", "NASO", "SRRB"))
 ripdata$ProjCode <- tempn[match(ripdata[,2], tempo)]
 
 
  
 ```
